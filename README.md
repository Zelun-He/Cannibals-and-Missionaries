The Missionaries and Cannibals problem is a classic river-crossing puzzle in artificial intelligence and game theory. The goal is to transport three missionaries and three cannibals across a river using a boat that can carry at most two people while ensuring that missionaries are never outnumbered by cannibals on either side of the river (otherwise, the cannibals eat the missionaries).

Problem Constraints
There are three missionaries (M) and three cannibals (C) on one side of the river.

There is a boat that can carry either one or two people.

At no point should the number of cannibals be greater than the number of missionaries on either side.

The goal is to get all six people safely to the other side of the river.
